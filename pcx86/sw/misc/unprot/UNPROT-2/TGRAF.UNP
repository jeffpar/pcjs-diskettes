Some time ago, I published an INCORRECT scheme for cracking
"TGRAF-05" by Grafpoint Corp.  This note contains the CORRECT
method for cracking TGRAF.  The problem with the first method was
that I was fooled into thinking the thing had been cracked, just
because I got it to start. Unfortunately, TGRAF loads a symbol
table from its protected track, and I had overlooked this.  This
causes all typed characters to be unreadable with a copy of TGRAF
which has been "cracked" by the original (faulty) scheme.

The correct scheme relies on the fact that the symbol table has
to be placed on a hard disk when TGRAF is installed to the H.D.
All we need to do is copy the symbol table and convince TGRAF
that it is ALWAYS running from a hard disk.


Here is the correct scheme:

First, copy the original TGRAF diskette using a copy utility such
as COPYWRIT or COPYIITC. Next, install TGRAF to an unused section
of your hard disk, using the HDI program.  TGRAF creates a hidden
file called GRFPT000.SYS on the hard disk.

Copy ALL of the TGRAF files to the hard disk.

Rename the EXE files CONFIGx.EXE to CONFIGx.XEX, so that they can
be loaded, modified, and re-written with DEBUG. Don't forget
TGRAF.EXE as well!

On each of the XEX files, use debug to search for the following
strings of bytes:


                         3D 40 1F 72 03

and

                     3B 84 00 04 B0 32 75 18

This can be done with the following DEBUG commands:

-S CS:0 L FFFF 3D 40 1F 72 03               (First string)

-S CS:0 L FFFF 3B 84 00 B0 32 75 18         (Second string)

in both cases, use debug to alter the last two bytes of these
strings to NOP's (hex 90):

                         3D 40 1F 90 90

and

                     3B 84 00 04 B0 32 90 90

Now use debug's WRITE instruction to copy the modified file to
disk.

-W                      (write file)

-Q                      (quit)

RENAME all of the .XEX files to EXE files.  Use a "file unhide"
utility, such as UNHIDE.COM or ALTER.COM, to unhide the file
GRFPT000.SYS. Now copy all of the files, including GRFPT000.SYS,
to a nice, clean, formatted blank floppy.

TGRAF-05 has been cleansed of nasty, embarassing copy-protection.

LET THERE BE SOFTWARE!
