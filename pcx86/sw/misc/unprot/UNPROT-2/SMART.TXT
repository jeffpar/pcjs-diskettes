To  unprotect  the "Smart System Disk",  use diskcopy to  make  a
backup,  or  load all files onto your hard disk.   Next using DEBUG
issue the instructions listed below:


debug smart.com
G 12F
T
G 9F35
T
G 31B8
T
G C760
T
G 22
T
A 27
JMP 29

A 807
JMP 885

G
Q



This begins execution, then modifys the partially executed file.  After
this process is complete, screen output is restored, and voila, you have
it - The Smart System - up and running.

I must confess I am new at this - have only had an MS-DOS machine
for two months,  so there may be a faster way.   I am working  on
it, and would appreciate any help.  Leave a message for me on any
Bay Area bulletin board.
