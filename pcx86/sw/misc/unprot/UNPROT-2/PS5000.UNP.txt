HOW TO UNPROTECT PROJECT SCHEDULER 5000 by SCITOR

FIRST, make a copy of your original diskette. NEVER, EVER, fool around
with the original copy--unless you like to DESTROY your software!

PS5000.EXE is heavily overlaid: it was linked with the PLINK86 linker,
and the machine code is a mass of spaghetti. The easiest way to "repair"
PS5000 is to use a disk zapper such as the Norton Utilities to patch the
hex bytes on the disk directly. So, using the COPY, NOT your ORIGINAL,
perform the following search-and-alter operations using NU:

Search the file PS5000.EXE for the following hex byte strings:

Search for:   9A 2C 01 8B 2E      (a call to routine which tests
                                   for presence of PS5000.EXE)
Change to:    B8 00 90 90 90      (get RID of it!)

Search for:   A1 32 7B            (memory move into AX)
Change to:    B8 01 00            (force the right value into AX)

Search for:   D1 E8 73 18         (a jump which we don't want)
Change to:    D1 E8 90 90         (get RID of it)

Search for:   8D 86 FE FD 50 B8 12 00 (careful here....!)
Change to:    8D 86 FE FD 50 EB 07 90 (jump to the right place)

Search for:   32 E4 40            (setting up AX for tests)
              B8 42 00            (make sure AX looks good)

When these patches are complete, PS5000.EXE has been fully and
completely repaired, removing the malicious damage that the manufacturer
did to the software in order to keep us from copying it!

LET THERE BE SOFTWARE!
