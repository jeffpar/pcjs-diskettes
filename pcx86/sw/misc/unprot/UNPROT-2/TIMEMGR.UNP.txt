
UNPROTECT IBM TIME MANAGER (80 Column Version) Version 1.00 -

1. Have a formatted, blank disk ready if copying to a floppy. Hard
   disk is OK, also.

2. Startup DEBUG from drive A.  Just type  DEBUG  <enter>

3. Place the TIME MANAGER program disk in drive A.
4. Type   L 600 0 A5 40  <enter>
5. Type   F 100,600 90   <enter>
6. Type   RCX            <enter>
7. Type   8000           <enter>

8. Place the formated, blank floppy in drive B

9. Type   NTM.COM        <enter>
10. Type  W              <enter>
11. Type  Q              <enter>

That's it. You now have the 80-column version of Time Manager on the
disk in Drive B. It is called TM.COM and can be started by simply
typing TM. 

BE AWARE!!! - the data diskette is non-dos and cannot be placed on a
hard disk. Also, while the program itself can be loaded from any drive
letter (A-Z), the data disk can only be on drives A or B.
The data disk is not protected and may be copied with DISKCOPY.


For the 40-column version, replace line4 with:

4. Type   L 600 0 65 40  <enter>

All others steps are the same.

If you wish to have both a 40 and 80 column version, change line 9
so that the name is descriptive of the version, i.e. NTM40.COM or
NTM80.COM.
