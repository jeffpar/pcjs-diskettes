HOW TO UNPROTECT VERSION 2.2 of VOLKSWRITER DELUXE

Volkswriter Deluxe, version 2.2, has a serial number embedded in
the code which is tested during program initialization. If the
serial number is found to be "corrupted", VX will not start, and
advises you to "INSTALL before running". Here is how to "corrupt"
the serial number of Volkswriter Deluxe in such a way that VX
will still operate:

1. COPY the program onto a fresh diskette. NEVER attempt to
modify your original!

2. Install the copy as you wish using the CONFIGUR program.

3. Using a disk utility such as Norton Utilities, or with DEBUG,
find the serial number near the beginning of VX.EXE and modify it
to suit your own desires. NOTE: if you use DEBUG, you will need
to RENAME VX.EXE to VX.XEX before this operation so that DEBUG
will let you write the modified program to disk after you're
done. Then you can rename the VX.XEX file back to VX.EXE.

4. Using a disk utility such as Norton Utilities, search the file
VX.EXE for the hexadecimal bytes which follow:

2A E4 29 06 82 2B

NOTE: THIS STRING OF BYTES OCCURS TWICE! WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE
SECOND OCCURRENCE, NOT THE FIRST!!!

These bytes correspond to the following assembly instructions:

SUB AH,AH
SUB [2B82],AX

Using your disk zap utility, alter the above bytes to:

B8 00 00 A3 82 2B

These bytes correspond to the following assembly instructions:

MOV AX,0
MOV [2B82],AX

If you have been careful to select the SECOND occurrence of the
original byte string, VX.EXE no longer cares what serial number
is installed in it.

If you have access to some other trace/debug utility, you can of
course search directly for the code above instead of using a disk
zap. However, when I tried this with DEBUG, the required bytes
were not found because they lie in a distant segment from the
beginning of the program and DEBUG's search terminated before
finding the bytes.

LET THERE BE SOFTWARE -- YO HO!
