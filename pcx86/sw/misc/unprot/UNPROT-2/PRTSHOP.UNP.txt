This one works friends....

	Print Shop has TWO different protection schemes.. the first looks
for a special floppy in drive A:, the second works for the harddrive install
(that a simple backup/restore will cause your install to be wiped out..)



>debug psinit.ovr
-a 2a3                    Step 1: Floppy protection
xxxx:02a3 mov ax,0000             this eliminates the look for the floppy....
xxxx: ..  jmp 0315
xxxx: ..(cr)

-a 222                    Step 2: Harddrive protection
xxxx:0222 jmp 025f                (very simple, always go for the floppy)
xxxx: ..(cr)
-w
-q

all done..

    Now you should be able to copy *.* from your diskette to another diskette
or a hard disk subdirectory and program will run without a diskette in a: or
without having to go thru the PSBACKUP program to put it on the hard disk. 
The program will turn on the A: drive light but does not check to see if there
is even a diskette in A:
