     The following procedure can be used to unprotect MULTIPLAN ver 1.0.
The steps required can be complicated if you are not accustomed to
using DEBUG, however, if followed exactly an unprotected version can
be produced.  If you prefer the process has been automated as explained
in Step 7 below.

             MULTIPLAN is copy protected in two ways.  First, track
11 sector 8 has been formatted as track 11 (0B) sector 61 (3D).  We
will trace through the program until this sector is loaded into
memory then write it back out to disk into a file name HIDDEN.DTA.
Secondly, one sector of the file MP1 is read into memory using an
Absoulute Disk Read (DOS interupt 25H) from a specific location.
Again, we will trace through the program until that point is reached,
and write the data loaded into memory back out to disk into a file
name HIDDEN.DT2.

     Using DEBUG, we will then create a short program named MPX.COM
that will take care of loading the above files into memory at
the proper time. Changes will be made to the Multiplan file MP80.COM
so it will load MPX.COM and to look for further files on the
default drive rather than Drive A:.  Finally, we will make changes
to the file MP1 so that control is transfered to MPX.COM when the
hidden data is to be loaded.

      The following instructions assume we are using a dual drive
PC.  If you are using a hard disk, make the appropriate substitutions
(C: for B:) and skip the first step.

      It is also recommended that no resident programs be loaded at
boot time prior to this procedure (such as Sidekick, etc.).  The reason
being we will use a few memory locations around 64K and do not want to
overwrite DEBUG or the operating system.

  1.  Format a blank disk in drive B: (the \S option for system
      files and single or double sided formating is optional)

  2.  Copy DEBUG.COM onto drive B:

  3.  Copy MP.UNP onto drive B:

  4.  Place your MULTIPLAN Ver 1.0 backup diskette in drive A: with
      the write protect tab in place.

  5.  Set the default drive to A:

  6.  A> COPY MP80.COM B:
         COPY MP1 B:        (When the Abort, Retry, Ignore message
                            apprears press I for ignore)
         COPY MP2 B:
         COPY MPMODE.COM B:
         COPY MP.SYS B:
         COPY MP.HLP B:      (This file is optional)

  7.  Issue the folowing command:   A> B:DEBUG < B:MP.UNP

                       - OR -

      You may do the same thing manually by following these
      instructions:

     A> B:DEBUG
