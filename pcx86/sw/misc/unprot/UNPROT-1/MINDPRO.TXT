
UNPROTECTING MIND PROBER


The operation to remove the copy protection is very simple. An added
benefit to removing the copy protection is the ability to put
Mind Prober on your hard disk, without the need to have the original
disk in Drive A: at startup time.

Follow the steps below for removing the copy protection. Be sure to do
this to a copy, and not to the original disk. Use the DOS COPY command
to make a copy onto another floppy, or to move a copy to your hard disk.
Then perform the DEBUG steps to the copy.

1) RENAME MP.EXE MP.1

2) DEBUG MP.1

3) S 0 F000 CD 13

(Note: Two locations should be found, at xxxx:70DC and xxxx:70EC. If they
       are not at these two addresses then stop, you must have a different
       version than I. The values xxxx are unimportant.)

4) E 70DC 90 90 90 90

5) E 70EC 90 90 59 EB

6) W

(Note: A 'Writing DC3A bytes' should be displayed. The above Edit commands
       tell the Mind Prober program to not bother looking for the bad
       sector located on the diskette.)

7) Q

8) RENAME MP.1 MP.EXE

You are now all through with the ëèrnges, and should have a non-protected
copy.
