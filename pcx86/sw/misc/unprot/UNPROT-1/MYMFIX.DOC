                  HARD DISK WITHOUT THE "KEY" DISK AND 
                      WITHOUT PROGRAM MODIFICATIONS 

         If you wish to run "Managing Your Money" (including version 
     2.0) from a hard disk, but are annoyed by the requirement for 
     having the original disk 1 in drive A, then read on....  

         Part of this ARC file is the program "MYMFIX.COM".  All you have to
     do is to include this program in your "autoexec" file when running
     Managing Your Money.  For instance, your "autoexec.bat" might look like
     this:

         DATE
         TIME
         MYMFIX  (to install "MYMFIX")
         MYM
         MYMFIX  (to uninstall "MYMFIX")

         That's all there is to it.  MYM will no longer look for the key 
     disk in drive A.  If you are using version 2.0 of MYM, when the 
     request is made to put the key disk in drive A, simply proceed as 
     though you had actually inserted the disk.  

     A request:

         If you find this program of value and wish to encourage the
     availability of similar programs in the future, then you may wish
