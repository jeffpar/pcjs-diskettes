I just recently bought a copy of Sierra On-Line's "Homeword" word processor 
for my kids.  They just can't master DisplayWrite yet.  It is a nice for the 
price program.  BUT, wouldn't you know, it's protected, with no provision for 
backup other than $15 and "we'll mail a new disk".  Fat chance! There is no 
way the kids won't destroy the disk.  So, to unprotect Homeword, first format 
a new system disk, then copy all the Homeword files to it.  Next, rename the 
Homeword program file HWCOMP.EXE to HWCOMP.TMP. With Dos in drive A: and the 
new Homeword Disk in drive B: enter: 

   debug b:hwcomp.tmp (CR) 
       e cs:59f eb 05 (CR)
       w (CR)
       q (CR)         

Now, rename HWCOMP.TMP to HWCOMP.EXE.

That should do it.  At least it worked for me on version 1.0
