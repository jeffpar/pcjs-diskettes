****************************** Managing Your Money Ver. 1.5 *******

  Those people who have Andrew Tobias' MANAGING YOUR MONEY and a
  Hard Disk find it very inconvenient to put Disk 1 in Drive A
  to start up MYM.  Below is an update to MYM Version 1.5 for
  people with Hard Disks to bypass this problem.  If you have
  only floppy disks drives, this procedure won't help much.

  First, make sure you run INSTALL and specify MYM is to be run
  using a Hard Disk.

  Second, make a copy of MYM.EXE using the following DOS command
  making sure that MYM.EXE is on your Hard Disk:
    COPY MYM.EXE MYM.PGM /V

  Third, run DEBUG against MYM.PGM as follows with your input to
  DEBUG shown by the arrow "-->" :

  -->  C>debug mym.pgm
  -->  -d 4709 470d
       XXXX:4709  B8 01 02 CD 13
  -->  -d 4744 4745
       XXXX:4744  75 CF
  -->  -d efd0 efdf
       XXXX:EFD0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  -->  -r cx
       CX EFD0
  -->  :  <cr>

  If the above 4 displays do not show the same output, you are
  probability at a different level of MYM and will have to figure
  out a corresponding update using data from above and below.

  -->  -a 4709
  -->  XXXX:4709 jmp efd0
  -->  XXXX:470C xor ax,ax
  -->  XXXX:470E  <cr>
  -->  -a 4744
  -->  XXXX:4744 nop
  -->  XXXX:4745 nop
  -->  XXXX:4746  <cr>
  -->  -a efd0
  -->  XXXX:EFD0 push bx
  -->  XXXX:EFD1 mov ax,1453
  -->  XXXX:EFD4 mov [bx],al
  -->  XXXX:EFD6 inc bx
  -->  XXXX:EFD7 dec ah
  -->  XXXX:EFD9 jnz efd4
  -->  XXXX:EFDB pop bx
  -->  XXXX:EFDC jmp 470c
  -->  XXXX:EFDF  <cr>
  -->  -r cx
       CX EFD0
  -->  :efe0
  -->  -w
       Writing EFE0 bytes
  -->  -q
       C>

  Finally, rename MYM.EXE to MYM.BAK .   Then rename MYM.PGM to
  MYM.EXE .   MYM.BAK is now your unmodified, original MYM program.
  Save it incase the new version does not work.  Your should no
  longer need to put Disk 1 in Drive A again.

  NOTE:  if you run the updated version of MYM.EXE from a floppy
  disk, you will be prompted to put Disk 1,2 or 3 in other drives.
  This new version must be installed using INSTALL specifying a
  Hard Disk and must executed from a Hard Disk to work.


****************************** Managing Your Money Ver. 2.0 *******


               HOW TO RUN "MANAGING YOUR MONEY(tm)" FROM A
                  HARD DISK WITHOUT THE "KEY" DISK AND
                      WITHOUT PROGRAM MODIFICATIONS

         If you wish to run "Managing Your Money" (including version
     2.0) from a hard disk, but are annoyed by the requirement for
     having the original disk 1 in drive A, then read on....

         Part of this ARC file is the program "MYMFIX.COM".  All you have to
     do is to include this program in your "autoexec" file when running
     Managing Your Money.  For instance, your "autoexec.bat" might look like
     this:

         DATE
         TIME
         MYMFIX  (to install "MYMFIX")
         MYM
         MYMFIX  (to uninstall "MYMFIX")

         That's all there is to it.  MYM will no longer look for the key
     disk in drive A.  If you are using version 2.0 of MYM, when the
     request is made to put the key disk in drive A, simply proceed as
     though you had actually inserted the disk.

     A request:

         If you find this program of value and wish to encourage the
     availability of similar programs in the future, then you may wish
     to contribute $10 to the author at the address below:
