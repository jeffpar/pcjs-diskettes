                 SPOTLIGHT - Unprotect
                                                    by The Lone Victor

     The following instructions show you how to bypass the SoftGuard
copy protection scheme used on SPOTLIGHT.

     First, using your valid, original SPOTLIGHT diskette, install it on
a fixed disk.  Softguard hides three files in your root directory:
CML0200.HCL, VDF0200.VDW, and SL.EXE.  It also copies SL.COM into
your chosen dBase directory.  SL.EXE is the real SPOTLIGHT program,
encrypted.  When you run SL, the program SL.COM loads CML0200.HCL
high in memory and runs it.  CML decrypts itself and reads VDF0200.VDW.
The VDF file contains some code and data from the fixed disk FAT at the
time of installation.  By comparing the information in the VDF file with
the current FAT, CML can tell if the CML, VDF, and SL.EXE files are
in the same place on the disk where they were installed.  If they have
moved, say from a backup & restore, then SPOTLIGHT will not run.

     Second, un-hide the three files in the root directory.  You can do
this with the programs ALTER.COM or FM.COM found on any BBS.

     Make copies of the three files, and of SL.COM, into some other
directory.

     Hide the three root files again using ALTER or FM.

     Following the  instructions, UNINSTALL SPOTLIGHT.  You can now
put away your original diskette.  We are done with it.

     Next we will make some patches to CML0200.HCL to allow us to trace
through the code in DEBUG.  These patches will keep it from killing our
interrupt vectors.

debug cml0200.hcl
e 3F9 <CR>  2A.4A <CR>          ; change the 2A to 4A
e 49D <CR>  F6.16 <CR>          ;  if any of these numbers don't show up
e 506 <CR>  E9.09 <CR>          ;  it's not working.
e A79 <CR>  00.20 <CR>          ;
e AE9 <CR>  00.20 <CR>          ;
e 73C  97 FA FA F4 F1 7E <CR>   ; this is an encrypted call to 0:300
w                               ; write out the new CML file
q                               ; quit debug


     Now copy your four saved files back into the root directory and
hide the CML0200.HCL, VDF0200.VDW, and SL.EXE files using ALTER or FM.

     We can now run SL.COM using DEBUG, trace just up to the point
where it has decrypted SL.EXE, then write that file out.

debug sl.com
r <CR>                          ; write down the value of DS for use below.
a 0:300 <CR>                    ; we must assemble some code here
        pop     ax
        cs:
        mov     [320],ax        ; save return address
        pop     ax
        cs:
        mov     [322],ax
        push    es              ; set up stack the way we need it
        mov     ax,20
        mov     es,ax
        mov     ax,0
        cs:
        jmp     far ptr [320]   ; jump to our return address
 <CR>
g 406                           ; now we can trace CML
t
g 177                           ; this stuff just traces past some
g 1E9                           ;   encryption routines.
t
g 54E                           ; wait while reading VDF & FAT
g=559 569
g=571 857                       ; SL.EXE has been decrypted
rBX <CR>                        ; length SL.EXE = 6700 bytes
:0                              ; set BX to 1
rCX <CR>
:6700                           ; set CX to AC00.
nSL                             ; name of file to write to
w XXXX:100                      ; where XXXX is the value of DS that
                                ;   you wrote down at the begining.
q                               ; quit debug

     Last, unhide and delete the three root files CML0200.HCL, VDF0200.VDW,
and SL.EXE.  Delete SL.COM and rename SL to SL.EXE.  This is the
real SPOTLIGHT program without any SoftGuard code or encryption.  It requires
only that the SPOTLIGHT utilities be in a sub-directory named SPOTLGHT.
