This patch allows the user to unprotect PrintMaster, published recently
(1985) by Unison World, Inc.  The following steps assume that DEBUG.COM
and the file PMMAIN.EXE are on the default disk drive.  If not, add
a drive specifier (A:, B:, C:, etc.) to the file names shown below.
The procedure is as follows:

     REN PMMAIN.EXE PMMAIN
     DEBUG PMMAIN
     S 0000 FFFE CD 13  (This should return an address in the form
          xxxx:6C73, where xxxx is the current code segment.  If the
          second part of the address is not 6C73, you have a different
          version, and this patch probably will not work.  If it is
          6C73, proceed with the following steps.)
     E 6C73 90 90
     E 6C7A 90
     W
     Q
     REN PMMAIN PMMAIN.EXE

The version you have now created will run from an unprotected
floppy in drive A, but since some of the file names used by the
program are hard coded to be on drive A, there is another step to be
performed before it can be run from the hard disk or RAM disk.
The DOS command ASSIGN A=C must be executed (assuming the hard disk
or RAM disk is drive C).  This will direct all calls for drive A to
drive C, where the program and its files are.
