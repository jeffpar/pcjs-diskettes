FOR THE USERS THAT HAVE 'TK!SOLVER' TK-1(2J)/PCDOS/IBM5150
-------------------------------------------------------------------

___________________________________________________________________


  IF YOU HAVE A HARD DISK OR WANT TO CREATE A BACKUP COPY THAT IS NOT
TIED INTO THE 'TK!'  DISKETTE...IN CASE YOUR ONLY COPY GOES BAD
.. THIS PATCH WILL REMOVE THE COPY PROTECTION COMPLETELY.... AS WELL
AS LET TK! RUN AS A STAND ALONE PROGRAM.

  AS ALWAYS THIS IS FOR YOUR PERSONAL PEACE OF MIND ONLY
IT IS NOT MEANT TO BYPASS ANY COPYRIGHTS..YOU ARE BY LAW BOUND BY
YOUR PURCHASE LICENSE AGREEMENT.

  IF YOU HAVE A HARD DISK AND WANT TO PUT THE PROGRAM ON SUCH
WHY SHOULD YOU BE TIED TO A FLOPPY. YOU HAD TO GIVE UP A LOT OF
MONEY TO GET YOUR HARD DISK.

 FIRST OF ALL WHEN I REFER TO THE "B:" DRIVE , IF YOU HAVE A HARD DISK,
SUBSTITUTE THE APPROPRIATE DRIVE LETTER FOR THE "B:" DRIVE. I ALSO ASSUME
THAT THE ORIGINAL "TK!" IS IN THE "A:" DRIVE.

1). FORMAT 1 SYSTEM DISK UNDER DOS 2.0 OR 2.1

2). LABEL IT ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL 'TK!' DISKETTE

3). COPY THE (UNHIDDEN) FILES FROM THE ORIGINAL DISKETTE TO THE CORRESPONDING
   2.X FORMATTED DISKETTE

4). PUT THE ORIGINAL 'TK!' DISKETTE IN THE "A:" DRIVE

5). COPY CON: B:SOFTARTS.(C)

     ENTER :THAT'S ALL FOLKS!
     PRESS :CNTL-Z THEN ENTER

     YOU SHOULD SEE: 1 FILE(S) COPIED MESSAGE

     THIS TAKES CARE OF THE HIDDEN FILES.

6). I WONT  TELL YOU HOW TO USE DEBUG OR  ANY 'PATCHER' PROGRAMS.

7). FIRST I ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE DEBUG.COM ON A RAM OR C: OR B: DRIVE .

8). ENTER >DEBUG

    ENTER -N A:TK.COM
          -F CS:100 L EFFF 0
          -L
          -N B:TK2.COM
          -R CX
          :EFFF

          -Q

9). ENTER >B:DEBUG B:TK2.COM


    ENTER -E 951 90 90 90                  'THIS DISABLES BREAK POINT
          -E 957 90 90 90                  ' AND SINGLE STEP OVERIDES
          -E 511 CC

    NOTE: THE ORIGINAL TK! SHOULD NOW BE IN THE "A:" DRIVE

          -G

    NOTE: PROGRAM SHOULD STOP AT CS:511

          WHAT WE DID WAS LET TK! READ ALL THE OTHER PIECES OF HIMSELF
          FROM THE VARIOUS DISK SECTORS (THE GOOD AND BAD SECTORS),
          DO ALL THE DECRYPTING AND SET UP ALL AREAS OF HIMSELF,
          IN OTHERWORDS WE LET HIM DO ALL THE WORK FOR US. WE DIDNT
          EVEN HAVE TO FOOL WITH BAD TRACKS, OR ANY DECRYPTING OURSELVES
          OH THE REASON FOR WRITING TK2.COM WITH LENGTH OF "EFFF"
          WAS TO RESERVE THIS PROGRAM AREA SIZE SO WHEN TK! RAN HE
          WOULD BUILD ALL HIS ROUTINES IN "OUR" PROTECTED PROGRAM AREA,
          THEN  WE CAN SAVE TK2.COM AS TK3.COM WITH ALL THE
          TK! SAFELY STORED IN OUR PROTECTED TK2 MEMORY AREA.
