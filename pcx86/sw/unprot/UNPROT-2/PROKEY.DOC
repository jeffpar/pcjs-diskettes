                       PROKEY  V1.1                    11/84

      Unprotects any program protected by Prolok.   Includes Realia Cobol, all 
      Ashton/Tate products (dBase 2 and 3, Framework), and Powerbase.  For the 
      hard disk user, this eliminates the inconvenience of inserting the "key" 
      diskette every time you run the program.

      In  case  you're not familiar with Prolok,  this is how it  works.   The 
      original  distribution  diskette you purchased  has  two  elements,  the 
      program  (put there by the publisher) and a track that was burnt with  a 
      laser  (put there by Vault Corp.,  the authors of Prolok).  You can copy 
      the program all you want --- to hard disk,  to backup copies,  etc.  --- 
      but  you  cannot copy the laser hole.   When you  execute  the  program, 
      either from hard disk or diskette,  special code written by Vault checks 
      A:  for  a diskette with a laser hole.   This is the "key" to unlock the 
      target program.

      PROKEY  is a resident program (put it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT).   The first 
      time  you  run the target program it would be best if you  had  a  good, 
      original,  distribution  diskette  in drive A:.   If you are  afraid  of 
      destroying  the original,  you can put a DISKCOPY of the original in  A: 
      and PROKEY will do its best to simulate the laser hole.

      PROKEY  is  heuristic (it learns).   The first time PROKEY watches  what 
      goes by and remembers it.   After that you will not need a diskette  any 
      more;   PROKEY will simulate it.   When moving to a new machine,  simply 
      copy the "tailored" PROKEY and the target program.   PROKEY can remember 
      the keys of up to four programs and will select the correct key automat-
      ically.

      P.S.  Ashton-Tate,  the prime customer of Vault and 20% owner,  has just 
            pulled  out.   Rumor is that the latest release of Prolok Plus  is 
            vicious.   If you tamper with it,  it installs a so-called "virus" 
            or  "worm" in your machine which corrupts or deletes  files.   The 
            combination  of user backlash,  loss of face (due to  Ashton-Tate) 
            and very heavy advertising expense should predict the end of Vault 
            Corp.
