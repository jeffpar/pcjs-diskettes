The following fix will eliminiate the bothersome requirement to
insert the FOCUS "activator" diskette in the A-drive everytime you
bring FOCUS up.   This change was made to a version of FOCUS
that had file dates of 05/11/84.  Be sure that you verify the code
that is in place before applying this zap.

RENAME FCPCINIT.EXE FCPCINIT.XXX
DEBUG FCPCINIT.XXX
  U 22AB L 5
(You should see "9A C5 02 14 02   CALL  0214:02C5"  display on the screen)
  E 22AB 90 90 90 90 90
  W
  Q
RENAME FCPCINIT.XXX FCPCINIT.EXE


That all there is to it.   Have fun.

Note added 6 DEC 84
Same procedure continues to work, only 5 bytes want to no-op
are at location 0C57:23E0
What you see at that location is CALL 021C:02C5
