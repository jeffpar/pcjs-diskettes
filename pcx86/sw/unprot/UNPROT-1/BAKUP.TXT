
HOW TO "UNPROTECT" "BAKUP" by Software Integration.

BAKUP is fairly well protected.  You must use a good copy program such
as COPYWRIT, or a hardware copy device such as the COPY II OPTION BOARD
to copy the distribution disk. If you use COPYWRIT, you must also run
RAMKEY before INSTALLING BAKUP.  Because BAKUP is "installed" on the
hard disk, and makes notes to itself about your system's configuration,
about the best you can do is to INCREASE the number of allowed installs.
The way to do this is as follows:

First, copy the distribution disk! NEVER fool around with your original
disk!

Next, using Norton Utilities on the copy, use SELECT FILE and select the
ROOT DIRECTORY.  Look at the byte at offset 48 (hex 30). This byte is
one of the "reserved" bytes for a hidden file whose name is the serial
number of your copy of BAKUP. For instance, if your serial number is
04123122442, the file name would be 04123122.442.

On a "new" copy of BAKUP, the value of this byte is 03, indicating 3
installs. If you've installed the distribution disk once or more times,
this byte may show 02, 01 or possibly 00.

Move the cursor to the byte, and type "FF" (FF hex, or 255 decimal, the
largest number that one can put in a byte).  Next hit ESC, and then
RETURN or F1 to write the new number of "installs" to the diskette.

If you now run the INSTALL program, you will find that BAKUP has
obligingly granted you 255 installs before you have to repeat this
procedure for 255 more installs...

For those unfamiliar with Norton's NU program, here's a script of
keystrokes for doing this. Assume NU is on B: and default drive is A:.
BAKUP copy is in A:.

A>B:NU<cr>
F1    <press function key 1>    (change selection)
F3    <press function key 3>    (select file)
<cr>  <enter key>               (select root dir)
F2    <press function key 2>    (explore disk)
F5    <press function key 5>    (display or modify)
<cr>                            (change display type)
<cr>                            (change display type again)
<press down-arrow twice>        (cursor should be at offset 48, hex 30)
FF                              (type "FF")
ESC                             (hit ESCAPE KEY)
<cr>                            (tell NU to WRITE)

Note: when fooling around with directories, BE CAREFUL! You can easily
mess up your disk.  REMEMBER: DON'T TRY THIS ON YOUR ORIGINAL DISK!!!

Note also: If you install, then uninstall with the altered install
count, BAKUP appears not to increment the number of installs. It will
show 254 installs available after one install/deinstall cycle.  However,
with this many installs, and the technique outlined here, this should
hardly present a problem...

LET THERE BE SOFTWARE!
