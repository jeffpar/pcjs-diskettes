The protection scheme for MS word is quite good.  The last track
is formatted with 256 byte sectors.  One sector, however, has
an ID that says it is a 1K sector.  If you try to read it as a 256
byte sector, you'll get a sector not found.  You can read it as a
1K sector with a guaranteed CRC error, and you will get the data
and other sector overhead from 3+ sectors.  They read it as 1K, and
use the bytes after the first 256 for decryption.  These bytes
constitute the post-amble of the sector, the inter-sector gap, and
the preamble to the next 256 byte sector.  If it's not formatted
with the correct inter-sector gap, it wont work.

The best way around this is to modify the MWCOPY program so it
will let you make more than one copy.  The below mods will let
you make as many backups as you want (and you can leave the
write protect tab on your master disk).  Of course, this method
should only be used by registered owners of Word.  If you, or any
of your IMF force is killed, the secretary will disavow any
knowledge of these patches.

We will copy MWCOPY to another disk, using another name (MWCP) so
you'll know it's the special version, and then modify MWCP.

************************* MICROSOFT WORD Ver. 1.1 ******************

Unprotection for Microsoft "WORD" Version 1.1 using the
Ultra-utilities (U-Format and U-Zap). June 22, 1984

    The following information is presented for those legitimate
owners who feel somewhat insecure when the availability of an
important program is dependent on the survival of a single floppy
disk.

    Microsoft's WORD uses a very good protection method. This
consists of a track (Side 1, Track 39) which is formatted with
twelve sectors. Sectors 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10 & 11 are all 256 byte
sectors. Sector 5 is formatted as a 1024 byte sector with a
inherent CRC error. The sectors on this track have an ASCII text
on the subjects of not stealing software and the names of the
people who worked on the development of the WORD package.

    Sectors 1,2,3 & 4, while presenting an interesting message, do
not directly affect the copy protection scheme. They would
appear to be a "red herring", to divert attention from the actual
protection area.

    Earlier versions of WORD were supplied with a program called
MWCOPY.COM which permitted a single floppy disk copy and a single
hard disk copy. If you have these versions use WORD.UNP or
WORDNEW.UNP which can be found on many BBS's.

    Version 1.1 is furnished with a single back-up floppy and the
utility programs furnished are MWCOPY1.COM, MWCOPY.BAT, and
MWCOPY2.BAT. These programs only permit a one-time copy to a hard
disk. No provision is included for a floppy copy.



    To make a floppy copy you will need the Ultra-Utilities, a
userware set of programs available on many BBS's. Of this set you
specifically need U-FORMAT.EXE and U-ZAP.EXE.

1)  Place a write protect tab on your copy of WORD.

2)  Make a copy of WORD with the standard DOS DISKCOPY command.
    (NOTE: There are hidden files, so the use of COPY will
    not work.

    DISKCOPY will report "Unrecoverable read errors on source
    Track 39 Side 1". Just ignore this.

3)  Start the U-FORMAT.EXE program. This can be done by removing
    the WORD disk and inserting your Ultra-Utilities disk. Once
    U-Format is started you can remove the Ultra-utilities disk
    and return the WORD disk to the drive.

4)  Select #5 (Display Radix) from the U-Format menu and change to
    decimal display.

5)  Select #4 (Display/Modify Disk Parameter Table) and set the
    following:

    #4 Bytes per sector = 001
    #5 Highest sector number per track = 012
    #8 Formatting gap length = 010

    All other values remain at the default settings.

    Quit to the main menu.

6)  Select menu item #3 (Format a Non-Standard Track)

    The program will ask if you intend to format a track with 12
    sectors. Answer = YES

    The program will then ask for the following information:

    SIDE  =  1
    DRIVE  =  (enter letter of the drive with the COPY disk)
    TRACK  =  39

    The program will then prompt for the following information:

    Physical Sector #   Logical Sector #   Sector Size
          1                   1               1
          2                   2               1
          3                   3               1
          4                   4               1
          5                   5               3
          6                   6               1
          7                   7               1
          8                   8               1
          9                   9               1
         10                  10               1
         11                  11               1
         12                  12               1

    After pressing "enter" in response to the prompt, you may exit
    U-Format.

7)  Start the U-ZAP.EXE program. This can be done by removing
    the WORD disk and inserting your Ultra-Utilities disk. Once
    U-Zap is started you can remove the Ultra-utilities disk
    and return the WORD disk to the drive.

8)  Select #8 (Display Radix) from the U-Format menu and change to
    decimal display.

9)  Select #11 (Display/Modify Disk Parameter Table) and set the
    following:

    #4 Bytes per sector = 001
    #5 Highest sector number per track = 012

    All other values remain at the default settings.

    Quit to the main menu.

10) Select #3 (Copy Disk Sectors) and use the following
    information:

    SOURCE DISK                     DESTINATION DISK

    SIDE  =  1                      SIDE  =  1
    DRIVE  =  (enter drive letter   DRIVE  =  (enter drive letter
               for WORD disk)                  for COPY disk)
    TRACK  =  39                    TRACK  =  39
    SECTOR  =  6                    SECTOR  =  6

        NUMBER OF SECTORS TO COPY  =  7

    The program will report "Sector Not Found"... "Re-Try (Y/N)"
    Answer  =  NO

    The program will then ask how many sides for the disk.
    Answer  =  2

    The program will then show the copy process.

    (NOTE: DO NOT copy the information from sectors 1,2,3,4,
    or 5.)

    You may then quit from U-zap to DOS.


    YOUR' DONE.


    The copy disk should work
