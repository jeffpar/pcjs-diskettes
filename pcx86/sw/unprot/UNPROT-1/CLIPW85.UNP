		How to Unprotect Clipper, Winter 85
 						by the Lone Victor

     This file tells how to remove the Softguard Superlok 2.03 copy
protection from Clipper Winter 85, on the file CLIPPER.W85
105984 bytes.  It will work with this file and no others.  
If it doesn't work, you probably have a different file.

     With this text file you should find a binary file CLIPPER.BIN.
You will need this file, ALTER, DEBUG, and your Clipper System Disk.

     Install your copy of Clipper on a hard disk as normal.  Using
ALTER or a similar utility, un-hide and copy the CLIPPER.W85 file.
Next, hide the file again and Un-Install Clipper.  Put your system
disk away for safe keeping.

     Now, using DEBUG execute the following commands:

	debug clipper.w85
	n clipper.bin
	l
	rbx <cr>
	BX 0000			;debug response
	:1
	rcx
	CX 1000			;debug response
	:9C92
	w
	Writing 19C92 bytes	;debug response
	q

	rename clipper.bin clipper.exe
	del clipper.w85

     You now have a complete working copy of CLIPPER. 

     If anyone has trouble with this copy of CLIPPR, please contact
me on the Atlanta IBM-PCUG BBS at 404-433-0062.
